Hi !

I am ACELY from China,and I'm doing lynda subtitles for nearly 2 years.
This is my website  www.cgsub.com
I wrote a desktop JAVA app to download and transcode data into .srt files.
And also wrote a translating engine to batch translate these data into Chinese
(Not accurate,but since most Chinese can't read English,so it may do some help).

Recently lynda.com changes,as you know.
And I've been tracing Lynda's URL allalong,here is what I found:

ADD "sdk/" in URL after "http://www.lynda.com/"
Means an URL like this:
http://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-tutorials/Photoshop-CC-One-One-Mastery/124099-2.html
should be modifyed like:
http://www.lynda.com/sdk/Photoshop-tutorials/Photoshop-CC-One-One-Mastery/124099-2.html
                    ↑↑↑↑↑
Hola!
Everything comes back!

Means you guys dont have to change your code AT ALL!
(Or just a code to automaticlly add "sdk/")

Have a good day!
